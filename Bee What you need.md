title: Bee What you need
---

To make Bee, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 - 1 metre of a suitable fabric ([see Bee Fabric options](/docs/patterns/bee/fabric/))
- (Optional)About 0.5 - 1 metre of lining fabric ([see Bee Fabric options](/docs/patterns/bee/fabric/))

<Note>

The lining fabric is if you want to make this pattern reversible. If you don't you only need the main fabric.  
You can use a serger/overlocker to construct this pattern but it is not mandatory.

</Note>
