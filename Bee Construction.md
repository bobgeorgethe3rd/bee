### Step 1: Construct the Neck Ties

#### Neck Ties One Colour Method

__1.__ Fold one of the neck tie pieces in half lengthwise, right sides and raw edges together.  
__2.__ Sew along the raw edges, leaving one of the short ends open.  
__3.__ Trim the seam allowances and clip the corners.  
__4.__ Turn inside out. Press.  
__5.__ Repeat Steps 1 - 4 for the other neck tie.  

#### Neck Ties Two Colours Method

__1.__ With right sides together, sew one main neck tie to one lining neck tie leaving one of the short edges open.  
__2.__ Trim the seam allowances and clip the corners.  
__3.__ Turn inside out. Press.  
__4.__ Repeat Steps 1 - 3 for the remaining neck tie pieces.    

### Step 2: The Cups

__1.__ With raw edges and main fabric together, ***Baste*** one of the neck ties to the top of the one of the cup pieces.  
__2.__ With the neck tie sandwiched inside, pin a lining cup piece right sides together to the main cup piece.  
__3.__ Sew the lining to the main between notches along top and sides making sure not to catch the neck tie and to reinforce the stitch at the notches.  
__4.__ Sew the lining to the main fabric along the bottom leaving a gap between the notches and the corners.  
__5.__ Trim the seam allowances of the sewn edges whilst leaving the seam allowance between the notches. Clip the corners. You may also need to clip the curved seams.  
__6.__ Turn inside out by pulling the neck tie through one of the gaps. Press.  
__7.__ (Optional) ***Edgestitch*** the top, sides and bottom of the cup leaving the gaps open.  
__8.__ Stitch along casing line to create band channel.  
__9.__ Repeat Steps 1 - 8 for the other cup.  

<Tip>

If your seam allowance is wide you may find that you need to trim the gaps seam allowances a little to reduce bulk. Just make sure you leave enough.

</Tip>
<Note>

Whilst certainly optional it is recommending to ***Edgestitch*** the top and sides of the cups but the bottom is entirely optional.  

</Note>

### Step 3: Band tie

#### Band Tie One Colour Method

__1.__ Fold the band tie piece in half lengthwise, right sides and raw edges together.  
__2.__ Sew along the raw edges, leaving one of the short ends open.  
__3.__ Trim the seam allowances and clip the corners.  
__4.__ Turn inside out. Press.   

#### Band Tie Two Colours Method

__1.__ With right sides together, sew the main band tie to the lining neck tie leaving one of the short edges open.  
__2.__ Trim the seam allowances and clip the corners.  
__3.__ Turn inside out. Press.  

### Step 4: Putting it all together.

__1.__ Thread the band tie through the gaps along the bottom edge of the cups, making sure the front sides of the cups are in the centre and that the main and lining sides are on the respective side.
