**Use a stretch stitch!**

### Glossary
- ***Edgestitch*** : Stitch 1/8" (3mm) away or closer from the seam

- ***Baste*** : Long temporary stitches to join pieces together. Can be machined or hand-sewn.

- ***Slipstitch*** : A concealed stitch to join folded edges to body or another folded edge.

Glossary Terms will be formatted in ***bold and italics*** below.

<Note>

When making a reversible top the second colour will be refered to as the lining fabric.  
The notches in this pattern act more like dots so **do not** clip them to mark them.

</Note>

### Step 1: Construct the Neck Ties

#### Neck Ties One Colour Method

__1.__ Fold one of the neck tie pieces in half lengthwise, right sides and raw edges together.  
__2.__ Sew along the raw edges, leaving one of the short ends open.  
__3.__ Trim the seam allowances and clip the corners.  
__4.__ Turn inside out. Press.  
__5.__ Repeat Steps 1 - 4 for the other neck tie.  

#### Neck Ties Two Colours Method

__1.__ With right sides together, sew one main neck tie to one lining neck tie leaving one of the short edges open.  
__2.__ Trim the seam allowances and clip the corners.  
__3.__ Turn inside out. Press.  
__4.__ Repeat Steps 1 - 3 for the remaining neck tie pieces.    

### Step 2: The Cups

#### Band Tie Variant

__1.__ With raw edges and main fabric together, ***Baste*** one of the neck ties to the top of one of the cup pieces making sure that the tie goes towards the bottom of the cup.  
__2.__ With the neck tie sandwiched inside, pin a lining cup piece right sides together to the main cup piece.  
__3.__ Sew the lining to the main cup between notches along the front, top and side seams, making sure not to catch the neck tie and to reinforce the stitch at the notches.   
__4.__ (Optional) Fold to the wrong side and ***Edgestitch*** the seam allowance down between notches on the front and side seams. Do not sew the allowances together!    
__5.__ Sew the lining to the main fabric between notches along the bottom leaving a gap between the notches making sure to reinforce the stitch at the notches.  
__6.__ Trim the seam allowances of the sewn edges whilst leaving the seam allowance between the notches. Clip the corners. You may also need to clip the curved seams.  
__7.__ Turn inside out by pulling the neck tie through one of the gaps. Press.  
__8.__ (Optional) ***Edgestitch*** the top, sides and bottom of the cup leaving the gaps between the notches open.  
__9.__ Stitch along casing line to create band channel.  
__10.__ Repeat Steps 1 - 9 for the other cup.  

<Warning>
  
Step 4 is an idea of how to secure the casing seam allowances down but may not be the best and does not need to be done so is optional. If you know of another way please let us know.
  
</Warning>
<Tip>

If your seam allowance is wide you may find that you need to trim the gaps seam allowances a little to reduce bulk.  
If you are having trouble turning the cups you can either;   
__1.__ Create a 2.5cm (1") gap in the front or side seam and turn throught that, either ***Slipstitch***-ing the gap closed or ***Edgestitch***-ing it closed during Step 7.  
  Or  
__2.__ Widen one of the existing gaps and turn through that. Then when turned ***Edgestitch*** or ***Slipstitch** the widened part closed. 

</Tip>
<Note>

Whilst certainly optional it is recommending to ***Edgestitch*** the top and sides of the cups but the bottom is entirely optional.

### Step 3: Band tie

You only need to do this step if making the band tie variant.

#### Band Tie One Colour Method

__1.__ Fold the band tie piece in half lengthwise, right sides and raw edges together.  
__2.__ Sew along the raw edges, leaving one of the short ends open.  
__3.__ Trim the seam allowances and clip the corners.  
__4.__ Turn inside out. Press.   

#### Band Tie Two Colours Method

__1.__ With right sides together, sew the main band tie to the lining neck tie leaving one of the short edges open.  
__2.__ Trim the seam allowances and clip the corners.  
__3.__ Turn inside out. Press.  

### Step 4: Putting it all together.

__1.__ Thread the band tie through the gaps along the bottom edge of the cups, making sure the front sides of the cups are in the centre and that the main and lining sides are on the respective side.  

### Step 5: Enjoy!

Hooray, your Bee Bikini Top is finished!
