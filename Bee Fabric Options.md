### Main and Lining Fabric

The main fabric and lining fabric are the same type of material. Bee is made with swimwear fabrics in such as lycras.

<Note>
 
You only need lining fabric if you intend to make the pattern reversible or if you want the band for the cross back tie variant to be a constrasting fabric.
